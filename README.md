Weird Data Science is an exploration of the esoteric, the bizarre, and the unknown with the terrible power of data science.

 - What is the probability of being abducted by aliens?
 - Are there seasonal patterns in cryptozoological sightings?
 - Are hauntings predictable?

These are just some of the questions that we aim to answer when the paranormal meets empirical data.

The truth is out there, within a given credible interval.
